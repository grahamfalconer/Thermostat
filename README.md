# Thermostat
Thermostat Challenge (AFTERNOON)

- [X] Thermostat starts at 20 degrees

- [X] You can increase the temperature with an up function

- [X] You can decrease the temperature with a down function

- [X] The minimum temperature is 10 degrees

- [X] If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees

- [X] If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees

- [X] Power saving mode is on by default

- []You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.


- [](In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)



 - [X] Decide what HTML elements you will need to serve as controls on the thermostat. Decide what HTML elements you will need to display the thermostat data.

   [displaying thermostat data]
.temp - Header on page showing current temp
.getUsage - displayed just under temp

  [buttons to interract with out thermostat]
.up - a button under our header saying "up"
.down - a button under our header saying "down"
.powerSavingModeOn - a button under our header
.powerSavingModeOff - a button under our header



 - [X] Build a static HTML page with these elements, labelling them with appropriate classes and/or IDs.
 You don't need to hook up your thermostat model to the user interface. That comes in the next challenge!


- [X] Add a script tag to load your thermostat JavaScript file into the page.

- [X] Open the developer console and check you can instantiate a thermostat object and call methods on it.
